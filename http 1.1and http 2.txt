Difference between HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1

HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol & it is used in client-server communication. By using HTTP user sends the request to the server & the server sends the response to the user. There are several stages of development of HTTP but we will focus mainly on HTTP/1.1 which was created in 1997 & the new one is HTTP/2 which was created in 2015.


HTTP/1.1

* It works on the textual format.

* There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources.

*It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages.

*It compresses data by itself.

HTTP/2

* It works on the binary protocol.

* It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.

* It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages.

* It uses HPACK for data compression.
